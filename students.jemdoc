== Advice: Mentality, mentality, mentality!

Many students have the question: what should I do to prepare for the graduate study? Usually students want a list of papers or books to read; they consider this the most essential part of preparation. I must say that I disagree. I believe mentality (initiative, attitude, etc.) is much more important than any technical skills, and the same is true for all fields beyond sciences and engineering. With the right mentality, everything follows.

The following article contains an excellent summary of advice for students (and even profs) to prepare their mentality for grad school. I just wish everyone could read it so that he/she doesn't have to learn the hard way.

== If you think you have the mentality ...

I am looking for graduate students and research assistants with strong interests and motivation to work on designing, building, and understanding networked systems, such as data centers. Students with hands-on systems building abilities (CS) and/or mathematical background (EE, math) are highly encouraged. Drop me an email if you are interested in working with me at CityU. \n

CityU CS is ranked highly according to [http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2013/computer-science-and-information-systems QS]. You can find more about our PhD program [http://www.sgs.cityu.edu.hk/prospective/rpg here], and Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme [http://www.sgs.cityu.edu.hk/prospective/rpg/hkphd here].
