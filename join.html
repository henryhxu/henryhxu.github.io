</li>
<li><p>Capable of doing independent research, and writing research papers </p>
</li>
<li><p>This position is six months minimum</p>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to apply</h2>
<p>Drop me an email with your CV, transcripts, and one representative paper if
any. If you're in HK already, email me to set up a time so we can
meet in person.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> I'm filtering all emails from <b>163.com</b>, <b>126.com</b> and <b>qq.com</b> due to
the junk emails they send. Please use other emails to contact me.</p>
<h2>PhD students</h2>
<p>I take 1-2 PhD students each year starting in fall. 
If you are interested in working with me, and have outstanding undergrad GPA
from CS, EE, or math background, feel free to email me before applying.
Although I may not have time to reply, I do read all of them. It is important
to choose me as your preferred advisor so that I can find your applications
easier. </p>
<h2>RA positions</h2>
<p>RA positions have more specific requirements on the student's background. You
must have a bachelor's degree before applying. It takes in general 2 months
to get a HK work permit if you are not local. The minimum duration is 6
months, and can be extended depending on performance. RAs with strong
performance will have a clear advantage towards applying to PhD
program. RA positions are usually full-time. Students with a HK study permit
or IANG permit can work as part-time RAs as well.</p>
<h2>Undergraduate students</h2>
<p>I encourage undergraduates to get involved in research early in the program. I
would be happy to provide advice on how to go about doing that, including what
opportunities are available in my group. 


</p>
<p>The best way to find me is to email me to setup a time, and stop by my office hours to introduce yourself.</p>
<h2>Visiting students/scholars</h2>
<p>I welcome visiting students/scholars to join my group and collaborate with
us. Email me if you are interested.</p>
<h2>Advice: Mentality, mentality, mentality!</h2>
<p>Many students have the question: what should I do to prepare for the graduate study? Usually students want a list of papers or books to read; they consider this the most essential part of preparation. I must say that I disagree. I believe mentality (initiative, attitude, etc.) is much more important than any technical skills, and the same is true for all fields beyond sciences and engineering. With the right mentality, everything follows.</p>
<p>The following article contains an excellent summary of advice for students (and even profs) to prepare their mentality for grad school. I just wish everyone could read it so that he/she doesn't have to learn the hard way.</p>
