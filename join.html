<h1>Joining my group</h1>
</div>
<p>I am always looking for students with strong background to work on designing, building, and understanding networked systems.</p>
<h2>Current openings</h2>
<p>[<b>PhD students</b>] </p>
<p><b>[New]</b> I am looking for PhD students to start in fall 2020 and fall 2021 at the <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/en/">CSE</a> department at CUHK. I will join CUHK in Oct 2020.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fall 2020 admission: Visit <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/zINwq9dTW6L9gCtng1jVwA">here</a> for more information; application site is <a href="https://dept-eappsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/pgas2020late/">here</a>. Deadline: <u>June 30, 2020</u>. Decision: <u>Mid July, 2020</u>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fall 2021 admission: Visit <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/en/education/prospective-students/postgraduate-admissions-programmes/mphil-phd-programme">here</a> for general information, including <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/en/education/prospective-students/postgraduate-admissions-programmes/mphil-phd-programme/early-admission">early admission</a>, <a href="https://www.gs.cuhk.edu.hk/admissions/programme/engineering">regular admission</a>, <a href="http://hkpfs.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/">PhD summer
workshop</a> in July 2020, and <a href="https://www.gs.cuhk.edu.hk/admissions/scholarships-fees/hkpfs">Hong Kong PhD Fellowship</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Indicate my name in your application, and send me an email with your application
material as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[<b>RA and post-doc</b>] </p>
<p><b>[New]</b> I am also looking for RA and post-doc to start in Sep/Oct 2020. To apply,
email me your CV and complete transcripts.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>RA: Strong programming skills in C/C<tt></tt>, strong CS fundamentals, experience
with GPU programming and machine learning frameworks. Experience with TCP stack and
container virtualization is also highly welcome.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Post-doc: Strong research experience (evidence with publications) in
systems and networking. Capable of doing independent research. This position is one
year in minimum.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to apply</h2>
<p>Drop me an email with your CV, transcripts, and one representative paper if
any. If you're in HK already, email me to set up a time so we can
meet in person.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> I'm filtering all emails from <b>163.com</b>, <b>126.com</b> and <b>qq.com</b> due to
the junk emails they send. Please use other emails to contact me.</p>
<h2>PhD students</h2>
<p>I take 1-2 PhD students each year starting in fall. There is no spring intake.
If you are interested in working with me, and have outstanding undergrad GPA
from CS, EE, or math background, feel free to email me before applying.
Although I may not have time to reply, I do read all of them. It is important
to choose me as your preferred advisor so that I can find your applications
easier. </p>
<h2>RA positions</h2>
<p>RA positions have more specific requirements on the student's background. You
must have a bachelor's degree before applying. It takes in general 2 months
to get a HK work permit if you are not local. The minimum duration is 6
months, and can be extended depending on performance. RAs with strong
performance will have a clear advantage towards applying to PhD
program. RA positions are usually full-time. Students with a HK study permit
or IANG permit can work as part-time RAs as well.</p>
<h2>Undergraduate students</h2>
<p>I encourage undergraduates to get involved in research early in the program. I
would be happy to provide advice on how to go about doing that, including what
opportunities are available in my group. 


</p>
<p>The best way to find me is to email me to setup a time, and stop by my office hours to introduce yourself.</p>
<h2>Visiting students/scholars</h2>
<p>I welcome visiting students/scholars to join my group and collaborate with
us. Email me if you are interested.</p>
<h2>Advice: Mentality, mentality, mentality!</h2>
<p>Many students have the question: what should I do to prepare for the graduate study? Usually students want a list of papers or books to read; they consider this the most essential part of preparation. I must say that I disagree. I believe mentality (initiative, attitude, etc.) is much more important than any technical skills, and the same is true for all fields beyond sciences and engineering. With the right mentality, everything follows.</p>
<p>The following article contains an excellent summary of advice for students (and even profs) to prepare their mentality for grad school. I just wish everyone could read it so that he/she doesn't have to learn the hard way.</p>
