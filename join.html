<h1>Joining my group</h1>
</div>
<p>I am always looking for students with strong background to work on designing, building, and understanding networked systems.</p>
<h2>Current openings</h2>
<p>[<b>PhD students</b>] </p>
<p>I am always looking for excellent students. See below for details.</p>
<p>[<b>2018/5 RA</b>] </p>
<p>I have 1 opening for Research Assistants. </p>
<p>Experience with Linux kernel, TCP stack is required. Experience with ML frameworks and/or RDMA are preferred.</p>
<h2>How to apply</h2>
<p>Drop me an email with your CV, transcripts, and one representative paper if any. If you're in CityU or in HK already, email me to set up a time so we can meet in person.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> I'm filtering all emails from <b>163.com</b>, <b>126.com</b> and <b>qq.com</b> due to the junk emails they send. Please use other emails to contact me.</p>
<h2>PhD students</h2>
<p>I take 1-2 PhD students each year starting in fall. There is no spring intake. If you are interested in working with me, and have outstanding undergrad GPA from CS, EE, or math background, feel free to email me before <a href="https://www.sgs.cityu.edu.hk/prospective/apply/procedures">applying to CityU</a>. Although I may not have time to reply, I do read all of them. It is important to choose me as your preferred advisor so that I can find your applications easier. 
Excellent candidates may be considered for the prestigious <a href="http://www.sgs.cityu.edu.hk/prospective/RPg/HKPhD">HK PhD Fellowship Scheme</a>.</p>
<h2>RA positions</h2>
<p>RA positions have more specific requirements on the student's background. You must have a bachelor's degree before applying. Monthly salary ranges from $13,000 to $16,000 depending on qualifications. It takes in general 2 months to get a HK work permit if you are not local. The minimum duration is 6 months, and can be extended depending on performance. RAs with strong performance will have a clear advantage towards applying to CityU’s PhD program. RA positions are usually full-time. Students with a HK study permit or IANG permit can work as part-time RAs as well.</p>
<h2>Undergraduate students</h2>
<p>I encourage undergraduates to get involved in research early in the program. I would be happy to provide advice on how to go about doing that, including what opportunities are available in my group. It is possible to join as a student helper, or via the CWS/CIS schemes of CityU. If you're a CS student, there's also the RMS and FYP. </p>
<p>The best way to find me is to email me to setup a time, and stop by my office hours to introduce yourself.</p>
<h2>Visiting students/scholars</h2>
<p>I welcome visiting students/scholars to join my group and collaborate with us. If you're a grad student, you can apply to be a <a href="https://www.sgs.cityu.edu.hk/prospective/visitingrpg/">visiting research student</a> at CityU.</p>
<h2>About CityU CS</h2>
